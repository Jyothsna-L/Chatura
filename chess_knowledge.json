The most common system is **Algebraic Notation**, which uses letters (a-h) for files and numbers (1-8) for ranks. \n\n**Basic Rules of Algebraic Notation:**\n1. **Piece Symbols:** Each piece (except the pawn) is represented by an uppercase letter:\n   - King = K, Queen = Q, Rook = R, Bishop = B, Knight = N\n2. **Pawn Moves:** Pawns are not labeled with a letter. Instead, their move is recorded by the destination square (e.g., 'e4' means a pawn moved to e4).\n3. **Captures:** A capture is denoted by 'x' (e.g., Bxe5 means the bishop captures on e5).\n4. **Castling:**\n   - Kingside castling = 'O-O'\n   - Queenside castling = 'O-O-O'\n5. **Check and Checkmate:**\n   - '+' denotes check (e.g., Qh5+ means queen gives check on h5).\n   - '#' denotes checkmate (e.g., Qh5# means checkmate on h5).\n6. **Pawn Promotion:** If a pawn promotes, the new piece is indicated after the move (e.g., e8=Q means the pawn moves to e8 and promotes to a queen).\n7. **En Passant:** This special capture is written normally like a pawn capture (e.g., exd6 if white captures black’s d5 pawn en passant).\n\n**Example Game in Algebraic Notation:**\n1. e4 e5  \n2. Nf3 Nc6  \n3. Bb5 a6  \n4. Ba4 Nf6  \n\nThis sequence represents the Ruy-Lopez opening. \n\nMastering notation helps you read chess books, study games, and record your own games for improvement!"
